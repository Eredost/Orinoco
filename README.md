# Orinoco #

**Fifth project of the brand new web developer course at Openclassrooms.
Orinoco wants to stand out from large e-commerce sites like Amazon by creating thematic applications selling only one group of products. There are for example Oribook for books or Oritextil for clothes.
The objective of this project is the establishment of an MVP of an e-commerce site, with the possibility of browsing through different articles, being able to put them in his basket and thus order them.**

## Prerequisites ##

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

## Installation ##

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
